# Connectify - iOS / Android Socializing Platform


Connectify is a modern real-time social networking app built using React Native and Expo for mobile development. It allows users to create profiles, post updates, follow other users, and interact through a sleek and responsive UI.

This project leverages a powerful backend powered by Convex, with Clerk for authentication and seamless cloud data handling. Designed with scalability and performance in mind, Mingle enables real-time updates, secure user sessions, and media support.


> [!NOTE]
> The app is not deployed online and can run only on local network. To deploy you need to create a Developer account (paid) at either of Apple Play Store (99$ /year) or Google Play Store(25$ one time fee).



> [!TIP]
> While a Website is in production to show how the app functions, the working demo screenshot of the app can be seen at my [Linked Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamad-a-ansari/) in the Projects section.
